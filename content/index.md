My name is Brian and Iâ€™m a certified Acro Revolution teacher based in Washington, D.C. I have over 5 years of experience doing acro, traveling around the United States learning advanced techniques and developing new skills and flows. Acro is a passion of mine and a never ending gift of vitality and fun!
