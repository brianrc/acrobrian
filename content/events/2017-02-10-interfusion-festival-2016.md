Interfusion Festival is a 3 day celebration of the human spirit. A safe space to explore, connect, & play. Interfusion is the largest art fusion festival on the east coast, including over 80 unique workshops & 3 nights of shows & parties.

I will be teaching two workshops with Maren Hill on the Saturday morning.
