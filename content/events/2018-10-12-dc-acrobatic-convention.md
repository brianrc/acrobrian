The D.C. Acrobatic Convention will bring together acrobats from around the country. Come and enjoy 3 amazing days of partner acrobatics, starting Friday and going through Sunday. Xtreme Acro and Cheer is a world-class gymnastics facility with more than 70 national champion titles in gymnastic acro, in addition to numerous international titles. This state-of-the-art 11,500 square foot facility is fully air-conditioned. There are two full 42x42 acrobatic gymnastics spring floors and two training belts above the acrobatics floor - including a twisting belt!
We will be providing classes for everyone from beginner to advanced. Classes will cover all styles of partner acrobatics, acro yoga, partner balancing, Icarian, static and dynamic standing acrobatics, and cheer.
